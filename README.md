# Dialogporten Flux manifests

This repository contains the Flux wiring and workload manifests for Dialogporten on DIS. Workloads are now packaged per environment as OCI artifacts and pulled by Flux.

## Layout
- `manifests/`: shared bases (`apps/`, `jobs/`, `common/`) plus per-environment overlays collected under `manifests/environments/<env>/`.
- `manifests/apps/<app>/base/`: canonical per-app base manifests (`web-api-eu`, `web-api-so`, `graphql`, `service`), aligned with job base layout (`manifests/jobs/<job>/base/`).
- `manifests/environments/<env>/apps/<app>/`: per-env app overlays that only patch app bases.
- `manifests/environments/<env>/kustomization.yaml`: concise env entrypoint that pulls all app/job overlays for that env and sets image tags.
- `flux/syncroot/`: bootstrap wiring (namespace, `OCIRepository`, and a Kustomization that targets the chosen `flux-system/<env>` path).

Current environments: `at23`, `tt02`, `yt01`, `prod`.

## OCI flow (high level)
1. CI publishes Flux OCI artifacts to ACR (`altinncr.azurecr.io`): syncroot from `flux/syncroot` and app manifests from `manifests/`.
2. `flux/syncroot/` defines an `OCIRepository` pointing to `oci://altinncr.azurecr.io/dialogporten/dialogporten-sync` with `tag: main`.
3. Flux pulls that OCI artifact, and the environment-specific `Kustomization` in `flux/syncroot/<env>` targets the `./environments/<env>` path within the artifact.

Application runtime images remain GHCR-hosted and are pinned by tags in `manifests/environments/<env>/kustomization.yaml`.

## Failure notifications

`Update all image tags` and `Publish Flux artifacts` send one Slack alert per failed workflow run through `.github/workflows/workflow-send-ci-cd-status-slack-message.yml`. Alerts include the repository, workflow, job results, a link to the run, and the requested environment/image tag or published ref/commit. Image-update alerts also cover input validation, checkout, tool installation, push, and publish-dispatch failures. Publishing alerts cover either artifact job, including validation failures. Successful, skipped, and cancelled runs do not send alerts.

Make these GitHub Actions secrets available to this repository, using the same names as Dialogporten's CI/CD notifications:

- `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`: Slack bot token with permission to post to the CI/CD status channel.
- `SLACK_CHANNEL_ID_FOR_CI_CD_STATUS`: ID of that channel; the bot must have access to it.

Slack delivery errors fail the notification job so an undelivered alert is visible in Actions.
